	<h2>Graphs</h2>
	<p>A mathematical graph is an abstract map of connections between nodes. Origami crease patterns leverage these, their creases are the graph's edges, ending at nodes shared by neighboring crease lines.</p>
	<p>Furthermore this kind of graph is embedded in the Euclidean plane; these are called <b>planar graphs</b>.</p>
	<div class="three-js" id="intersection-wobble"></div>
	<pre><code><span id="span-intersection-results"></span>planarGraph.<a href=""><f>fragment</f></a>();</code></pre>
	<p class="quote">Edges in a planar graphs are not allowed to cross. An overlapped edge must be split into two with a node added at the intersection.</p>
	<p>The aim of this library is for origami designs to be able to be created entirely in code, making every component accessible, flexible, and parametric.</p>
